# Contributions

## IMPORTANT: No NDA-Protected Information

This project is intended for public and open-source collaboration. Under no circumstances should any information protected under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) be captured, shared, or otherwise used within this project.

All contributors must ensure that their contributions do not violate any confidentiality agreements they may have with current or former employers, clients, or any other party.

### Prompt Generation and Data Integrity

To ensure the integrity and confidentiality of all parties, the base META prompt and all subsequent persona prompts were generated using a clean source account. This account has never had access to any confidential or proprietary information, ensuring that all generated content is free from any potential NDA-protected data.

We take this matter very seriously. Any contribution found to contain NDA-protected information will be immediately removed.
