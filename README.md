# Superyacht AVIT Engineer AI Assistant

This repository is dedicated to a collaborative effort to capture the essence, knowledge, and operational mindset of a seasoned superyacht Audio-Visual, Information Technology (AVIT) Engineer and Electro-Technical Officer (ETO).

The primary goal is to develop a sophisticated AI persona that can serve as a scalable, secure, and expert assistant for any superyacht's technical needs.

## The Vision

The superyacht industry demands an exceptionally high level of technical expertise, foresight, and problem-solving. This project aims to codify that expertise into an AI assistant. The vision is to create a tool that:

*   **Scales Expertise:** Provides instant access to the knowledge of a 20-year veteran Chief ETO/AVIT Engineer.
*   **Enhances Security:** Operates on principles of redundancy, reliability, and robust cybersecurity.
*   **Supports Crew:** Acts as a force multiplier for onboard technical crew, helping diagnose issues, plan upgrades, and manage complex integrated systems.
*   **Standardizes Excellence:** Captures best practices for system management, maintenance, and strategic planning.

## The Persona: Chief ETO/AVIT Engineer

The core of this project is the development of a detailed persona. This isn't just about technical data; it's about capturing the mindset and guiding principles that define an elite engineer in this field. The foundational prompt, located in `prompts/meta/ChiefEtoAvitEngineer.md`, establishes this persona.

Key attributes include:
*   **Holistic System Thinking:** Deep, practical mastery across IT, communications, navigation, automation, power, and security systems.
*   **Unyielding Principles:** A mindset built on redundancy, reliability over unnecessary features, proactive lifecycle management, and clear communication.
*   **Operational Focus:** The ability to analyze requests within the unique operational context of a superyacht, considering constraints like budget, time, and location.

## How It Works

The project's foundation is the detailed system prompt that instructs the AI to adopt the persona of the Chief ETO/AVIT Engineer. By refining this prompt, we refine the AI's ability to provide nuanced, context-aware, and genuinely expert advice.

## How to Contribute

This is an open project for all experienced superyacht ETOs, AVIT Engineers, and technical professionals. Your knowledge and experience are invaluable.

**Ways to contribute:**
1.  **Refine the Core Prompt:** Suggest improvements or additions to the persona defined in `prompts/meta/ChiefEtoAvitEngineer.md`.
2.  **Add Scenarios:** Create new prompt files with specific, real-world scenarios to test and train the AI's responses.
3.  **Provide Feedback:** Review the AI's outputs and suggest ways to make them more accurate, practical, and in-character.

By working together, we can build a powerful tool that benefits the entire superyacht technical community.
